        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                Chicken katsu is made of chicken breast fillet breaded with flour, egg, and Japanese panko 
                breadcrumbs, then deep-fried until golden brown. It’s the chicken counterpart of Tonkatsu or pork cutlet.
            </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <h4>Sauce</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>½ cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>¼ cup ketchup</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
                <li>pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Chicken</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups vegetable oil, for deep-fat frying</li>
                <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>½ cup panko bread crumbs</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
                <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to 1/4 inch thickness</li>
                <li>1 green onion, thinly sliced</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>For the sauce, stir together the Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, and soy sauce, and a pinch of pepper to taste. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in deep-fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Place flour and panko bread crumbs onto separate plates and season with salt and pepper. Place the beaten egg in a medium
                    bowl. Dip flattened chicken pieces first into flour, then egg, and lastly bread crumbs.</li>
                <li>Fry breaded chicken breasts in preheated oil until golden brown and no longer pink in center, about 8 minutes. Transfer to 
                    a paper towel-lined plate to absorb excess oil. Slice chicken into thin strips and top with a drizzle of sauce and a 
                    sprinkling of sliced green onions. Serve remaining sauce on the side for dipping.</li>
            </ol>
